Note: If you do not join a group and work with someone else your score will be reduced by 25%.

Only one person in the group will need to submit the final code. Because this is a group assignment you do not need to commit any changes to a repo. Your grade will be based solely on the code submitted below.

For this assignment, you will need to clone the repo: Week 03: Programming Assignment 1Links to an external site.. Once cloned, develop a program to do the following:

Prompts the user to enter a number within the range of 1 through 10. The program should display the Roman numeralLinks to an external site. version of that number.

Notes:

The letters to use for the roman numerals are uppercase i, v, and x.
The program should present the output in a neat and intuitive format. Use your best judgement.
Your program must not contain any code that has not been covered in this class so far or your grade will be reduced.
Your program must contain only C++ code, or your grade will be reduced. As an example, use const and not #define.
If your program contains magic numbers (Links to an external site.) your grade will be reduced.
